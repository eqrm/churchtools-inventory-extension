# Implementation Digest

This document consolidates the historical markdown reports that previously lived in the repository root.

## Phase 2 – Foundational Infrastructure (Jan 2025)
_Source: `PHASE2-COMPLETE.md`_

- Copied core entity/storage/API types into `src/types` and enforced strict typing across services.
- Introduced `ChurchToolsAPIClient`, typed error handling, and a 30‑minute TTL person cache.
- Added storage provider factory with ChurchTools, Offline (stub), and Mock implementations plus Dexie schema stubs.
- Created shared UI primitives (`LoadingState`, `ErrorState`, `EmptyState`, `ConfirmDialog`).
- Added Zustand stores (`uiStore`, `scannerStore`) and hooks for online status and current user.
- Resulting bundle footprint: 138.5 KB gzipped, leaving 30% budget headroom.

## Phase 4 – Custom Field Validation (20 Oct 2025)
_Source: `PHASE4_PROGRESS.md`_

- Completed nine-field-type validation (`text`, `long-text`, `number`, `url`, `select`, `multi-select`, `date`, `checkbox`, `person-reference`).
- Centralised logic in `validateCustomFieldValue` with helpers for emptiness, numeric ranges, regex rules, and option guards.
- Asset forms now stop submission on the first invalid custom field and surface inline errors.
- Category deletion checks guard against orphaning assets by counting current usage.
- Deferred items: custom field preview, advanced filtering/sorting, template duplication, and icon picker enhancements.

## Phase 5 – Book on Behalf of Others
_Source: `PHASE5_SUMMARY.md`_

- Booking entities already carried `bookedBy*` and `bookingFor*` fields; ensured consistent usage across UI and API payloads.
- `BookingForm` defaults recipient to the current user, supports avatar-backed PersonPicker, and displays both parties.
- Booking detail and list views render both persons via `PersonDisplay`, with fallbacks to legacy `requestedBy` fields for backwards compatibility.
- Added placeholder for future permission gating once ChurchTools exposes granular policies.
- Manual verification (T053–T056) remains outstanding and is captured in `specs/TASKS.md`.

## Phase 8 – Equipment Kits (21 Oct 2025)
_Source: `PHASE8_SUMMARY.md`_

- Completed kit CRUD, availability checks, and TanStack Query hooks (`useKits`, `useKitAvailability`, `useCreateKit`, etc.).
- Implemented list/detail UI plus availability indicators; form and builder components exist as functional stubs awaiting richer UX.
- Booking integration tasks (T139–T142) remain optional and are logged for future work.
- Documented known follow-ups (function length refactors, enhanced selection UI) for when kit booking becomes a requirement.

## UI Integration Audit (18 Jan 2025)
_Source: `COMPREHENSIVE-UI-AUDIT.md`_

- Confirmed 172+ components across 11 routes; identified missing surface areas for Reports, Maintenance dashboard, and Enhanced Asset views.
- Settings tabs existed for Asset Numbering, Asset Prefixes, Locations, Scanners, and General (placeholder).
- Highlighted hidden navigation entries (Reports, Maintenance) and recommended wiring `EnhancedAssetList` instead of the basic table.
- Recorded action items `T-AUDIT-001` through `T-AUDIT-003` for follow-up (now tracked in `specs/TASKS.md`).

## Cross-Cutting Themes

- **Design Decisions**: Abstractions (photo storage, permissions, schema migrations) implemented early to smooth future expansion, even if current behaviour is stubbed.
- **Localization**: Historical docs contained German UI copy; ongoing work converts those strings to English to align with current specification.
- **Performance**: Bundle budget extended to 5 MB to reflect ChurchTools 20 MB deployment limit, with existing builds well below threshold.

## Consolidated References

- Active tasks, including deferred manual tests and audit follow-ups, are maintained in `specs/TASKS.md`.
- Detailed per-phase specs remain in `specs/001-*/` and `specs/002-*/` for archival completeness.
- Future status updates should append to this digest instead of creating ad-hoc root-level markdown files.
