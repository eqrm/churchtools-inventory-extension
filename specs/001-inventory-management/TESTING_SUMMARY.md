## ‚ùå What Needs Fixing

### Critical Blockers (Week 1 - 24 hours)
1. **Deletion 405 Error** - Can't delete categories/assets
2. **Change History Unreadable** - Shows raw JSON instead of formatted changes
3. **No Category History** - Category changes not tracked
4. **Navigation Broken** - Page reload causes error
5. **No Network Errors** - No feedback when offline

### High Priority UX (Week 2 - 22 hours)
6. **Missing Barcode Display** - Only QR codes shown
7. **Number Validation** - Auto-corrects without showing error
8. **ISO Date Format** - Should show readable dates
9. **URLs Not Clickable** - Should be hyperlinks
10. **No Empty State CTAs** - New users don't know what to do
11. **Slow Filtering** - Takes too long

### Medium Priority (Week 3 - 12 hours)
12. **No Restore Feature** - Deleted assets gone forever
13. **Text Length Limit** - ChurchTools 10K limit not documented

## üöÄ Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Fix Critical Issues First (Recommended)
**Timeline**: 3-4 days  
**Outcome**: Stable MVP ready for production

```bash
# Week 1 Focus
1. Fix deletion 405 error (2h)
2. Fix navigation/routing (4h)  
3. Fix change history (8h)
4. Add category history (4h)
5. Add network errors (6h)

# Then deploy to TEST environment
```

### Option B: Continue with New Features
**Timeline**: Depends on feature  
**Risk**: Building on unstable foundation

Not recommended - fix critical issues first!

### Option C: Pause and Discuss
**Timeline**: TBD  
**Action**: Review bug fix plan with stakeholders

Get input on:
- Change history format preference
- Soft delete UI design
- Barcode vs QR default
- Production timeline

---

## üí° Design Decisions Needed

Before proceeding, decide on:

### 1. Change History Format
**Option A** (Recommended):
```
10/20/25, 10:24 AM User changed Status from "Available" to "In Use"
```

**Option B**:
| Date | User | Field | Old Value | New Value |
|------|------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| 10/20/25 | User | Status | Available | In Use |

### 2. Soft Delete UI
**Option A**: Checkbox "Show Deleted" in asset list (simpler)  
**Option B**: Separate "Deleted Assets" page (clearer)

### 3. Barcode Default
- Should QR or Barcode be default?
- Should choice persist per user?
