# Specification Quality Checklist: ChurchTools Inventory Management Extension

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-18  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - The specification focuses entirely on WHAT users need and WHY, without mentioning specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation approaches. All descriptions are written in plain language suitable for business stakeholders.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All 60 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. The specification makes reasonable assumptions based on industry-standard inventory management practices.

### Success Criteria Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All 12 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic. They focus on user-facing outcomes (time to complete tasks, success rates, user adoption) rather than technical metrics.

### User Scenarios Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Nine prioritized user stories (2x P1, 3x P2, 4x P3) cover the complete feature scope from basic asset tracking through advanced reporting. Each story is independently testable with clear acceptance scenarios.

### Edge Cases Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Nine edge cases identified covering booking conflicts, scanning errors, parent-child asset relationships, kit conflicts, maintenance workflow exceptions, and damaged barcodes.

### Scope and Dependencies Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Scope is clearly defined through user stories and functional requirements. The specification identifies integration with ChurchTools user system for authentication and user references. The ChurchTools custom module API endpoints (from README) are referenced as the foundation for data persistence.

## Assumptions Documented

The specification makes the following reasonable assumptions based on ChurchTools extension patterns and industry standards:

1. **Authentication**: Extension uses existing ChurchTools authentication system (no separate login required)
2. **Data Persistence**: Uses ChurchTools custom module API endpoints documented in README (custommodules, customdatacategories, customdatavalues)
3. **User References**: Leverages ChurchTools Person entity for creator/modifier tracking
4. **Notifications**: Assumes ChurchTools has notification infrastructure or email can be sent via API
5. **File Uploads**: Assumes ChurchTools supports file attachments for maintenance photos
6. **Date Handling**: Standard ISO date formats with timezone awareness
7. **Number Formatting**: Standard numeric conventions for quantities, measurements
8. **Offline Support**: Limited to stock take functionality (not all features)
9. **Report Export**: Common formats (CSV, PDF, Excel) assumed
10. **Browser Support**: Modern browsers supporting HTML5, ES6+ (Chrome, Safari, Firefox as stated in testing standards)

## Notes

✅ **Specification is READY for next phase** - All checklist items pass. The specification provides a complete, unambiguous foundation for `/speckit.plan` command.

No clarifications required - all requirements are clear and testable with reasonable industry-standard assumptions documented above.
