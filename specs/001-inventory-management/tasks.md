## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - **BLOCKS all user stories**
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Can start after Phase 2 complete
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 (most implementation shared)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Can start after Phase 2 complete (independent of US1/US2)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on User Story 1 (extends asset creation)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on User Story 1 (requires assets to book)
- **User Story 6 (Phase 8)**: Depends on User Story 5 (extends booking with kits)
- **User Story 7 (Phase 9)**: Depends on User Story 3 (requires scanning) and User Story 1 (requires assets)
- **User Story 8 (Phase 10)**: Depends on User Story 1 (requires assets to schedule maintenance)
- **User Story 9 (Phase 11)**: Depends on User Story 1 (requires assets to filter/report)
- **Polish (Phase 12)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

```

### Recommended Implementation Order

**Option A: MVP First (Fastest to Value)**
1. Setup (Phase 1)
2. Foundational (Phase 2) ‚Üê **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
3. User Story 1 (Basic Assets) ‚Üê **MVP CORE**
4. User Story 2 (Custom Fields) ‚Üê **Completes MVP**
5. **STOP and VALIDATE** - Deploy MVP
6. User Story 5 (Bookings) ‚Üê **High value P2**
7. User Story 3 (Scanning) ‚Üê **High value P2**
8. Remaining stories as needed

**Option B: Priority Order (By Spec)**
1. Setup + Foundational
2. US1 + US2 (both P1 - asset management foundation)
3. US3, US4, US5 (all P2 - can parallelize if team capacity)
4. US6, US7, US8, US9 (all P3 - can prioritize based on user feedback)

**Option C: Parallel Teams**
1. Setup + Foundational (whole team)
2. Split teams after Phase 2:
   - Team A: US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US4 (asset management track)
   - Team B: US3 (scanning - independent)
   - Team C: US5 ‚Üí US6 (booking track)
3. Merge and integrate
4. Team D: US7, US8, US9 (advanced features)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Foundational Phase** (all can run in parallel after T016-T018 complete):
- T019-T021: API client
- T022-T025: Storage providers
- T026-T028: Utilities
- T029-T030: State stores
- T031-T034: Common components
- T035-T037: Custom hooks

**Within User Story 1** (parallel groups):
- T042-T045: Category UI (after T046 complete for testing)
- T047-T052: Asset UI (after T053-T055 complete for testing)
- T056-T057: Change history UI (after T058 complete)

**Across User Stories** (after Foundational complete):
- US3 (scanning) is independent of US1/US2 - can parallelize
- US4 (parent-child) and US5 (bookings) both depend on US1 but not each other - can parallelize after US1

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# After type definitions are in place (T016-T018), launch all service layers in parallel:

Team Member 1: T019-T021 (ChurchTools API client + error handling)
Team Member 2: T022-T025 (Storage providers + Dexie DB)
Team Member 3: T026-T028 (Utilities: formatting, validation, asset numbering)
Team Member 4: T029-T030 (Zustand stores: UI state + scanner state)
Team Member 5: T031-T034 (Common components: Loading, Error, Empty, Confirm)
Team Member 6: T035-T037 (Custom hooks: storage provider, online status, current user)
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# After storage provider methods are implemented (T046, T053-T055, T058), launch all UI in parallel:

Team Member 1: T042-T045 (Category management UI)
Team Member 2: T047-T052 (Asset management UI)
Team Member 3: T056-T057 (Change history UI)
Team Member 4: T059-T063 (Integration: routing, navigation, notifications)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T015) ‚Üê ~2-4 hours
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T016-T041) ‚Üê **CRITICAL** ~8-16 hours
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T042-T063) ‚Üê ~16-24 hours
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T064-T075) ‚Üê ~8-12 hours
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test MVP independently
6. Deploy/demo basic asset management with custom fields
7. Gather user feedback before continuing

**MVP Scope**: Basic asset tracking with custom categories and fields. Users can:
- Create asset categories with custom field definitions
- Create/edit/delete assets with custom field values
- View asset lists with filtering and sorting
- See change history for audit trail
- This delivers immediate value for basic inventory tracking

### Incremental Delivery (Add Stories Sequentially)

1. MVP (US1 + US2) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
2. Add US5 (Bookings) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy (now have reservation system)
3. Add US3 (Scanning) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy (now have barcode/QR support)
4. Add US4 (Parent-Child) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy (now have bulk asset creation)
5. Add US7 (Stock Take) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy (now have physical inventory audits)
6. Add US8 (Maintenance) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy (now have compliance tracking)
7. Add US6 + US9 as needed (kits + advanced reporting)

**Benefit**: Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality. Users can start using the system early and provide feedback.

### Parallel Team Strategy (If 3+ Developers)

**Week 1**: Whole team on Setup + Foundational (T001-T041)
- **Checkpoint**: Foundation ready, constitution gates pass

**Week 2**: Split into tracks
- **Track A** (2 devs): US1 + US2 (Asset Management)
- **Track B** (1 dev): US3 (Scanning)

**Week 3**: Merge and integrate
- **Checkpoint**: MVP ready with scanning support

**Week 4**: Split again
- **Track A** (2 devs): US5 + US6 (Booking + Kits)
- **Track B** (1 dev): US4 (Parent-Child)

**Week 5**: Final features
- **Track A** (1 dev): US7 (Stock Take)
- **Track B** (1 dev): US8 (Maintenance)
- **Track C** (1 dev): US9 (Reports)

**Week 6**: Polish + Testing + Deployment
- Whole team on Phase 12 (Polish) and quality gates

- **Foundational Phase**: 22 parallel tasks (most of T016-T037)
- **User Story Phases**: 30+ tasks can run in parallel within each story
- **Cross-Story**: US3, US4, US5 can run in parallel after US1 complete

### MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product** = Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 + Phase 4
- **Total**: 75 tasks (15 + 26 + 22 + 12)
- **Estimated Effort**: 40-60 developer hours
- **Delivers**: Complete basic asset management with custom fields
- **Value**: Organizations can immediately start tracking inventory

## Constitution Compliance Summary

All tasks designed to comply with project constitution v1.0.0:

‚úÖ **Type Safety First**: TypeScript strict mode enforced (T009, T038), all contracts typed (T016-T018)  
‚úÖ **User Experience Consistency**: Mantine UI configured to match ChurchTools (T013), responsive design throughout  
‚úÖ **Code Quality**: ESLint configured (T010, T039), JSDoc required (T228), < 50 line functions encouraged  
‚úÖ **Performance Budget**: Bundle size monitored (T041, T219-T220), code splitting implemented (T215), virtualization added (T214)  
‚úÖ **Testing Strategy**: Manual testing required (T238-T241), automated tests for complex logic (T234-T237)  
‚úÖ **Maintainability**: Feature-based organization, clear separation of concerns, comprehensive documentation (T228-T233)

---

## Notes

- **[P] marker**: Task can run in parallel with others in its phase (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story (US1-US9) for traceability and independent testing
- **Checkpoint comments**: Natural stopping points to validate story independently before proceeding
- **MVP indicators üéØ**: Tasks that are part of the minimum viable product
- **Blocker indicators ‚ö†Ô∏è**: Tasks that block other work from starting

**Development Approach**:
- Commit after each task or logical group of tasks
- Run TypeScript compilation and ESLint after each phase
- Test user stories independently at checkpoints
- Measure bundle size frequently (especially after adding libraries)
- Use TanStack Query DevTools during development for cache inspection
- Use React DevTools for component performance profiling

**Remember**: Each user story should be independently completable and testable. Avoid creating dependencies between stories unless absolutely necessary. This enables incremental delivery and parallel development.
