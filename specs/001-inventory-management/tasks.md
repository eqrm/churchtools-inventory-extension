## Phase 2.5: Automated Testing Infrastructure Setup (Priority: P0) üß™

**Purpose**: Set up comprehensive automated testing infrastructure before user story implementation

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: This phase MUST be complete before Phase 3 to ensure all business logic can be automatically tested

**Testing Strategy**: Automated tests for ALL business logic (services, hooks, utilities, custom fields, bookings, kits, etc.). Manual testing ONLY for UI/UX (visual design, responsiveness, accessibility).

**Environment Isolation**: Automatic prefix based on context:
- Tests (Vitest): `test-inventory-management` (destructive tests allowed, automatically used when running `npm test`)
- Development (VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development): `dev-inventory-management` (manual testing)
- Production (VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production): `prod-inventory-management` (real user data)

### Environment Configuration

- [x] T041l Add VITE_ENVIRONMENT variable to .env.example (values: 'development' or 'production', default: 'development')
- [x] T041m Update src/hooks/useStorageProvider.ts to automatically use prefix based on context:

### Test Directory Structure

- [x] T041p Create test directory structure:
  - `src/services/__tests__/` (service layer tests)
  - `src/hooks/__tests__/` (TanStack Query hook tests)
  - `src/utils/__tests__/` (utility function tests)
  - `src/components/__tests__/` (component logic tests)
  - `src/tests/integration/` (end-to-end workflow tests)

### CI/CD Integration

  - Node version: 20.x

### Testing Documentation

- [x] T041r Create docs/TESTING.md with:
  - Testing strategy overview (automated vs manual)
  - Running tests locally (`npm test`, `npm run test:ui`, `npm run test:coverage`)
  - Writing tests (examples for services, hooks, components, integration)
  - Automatic environment isolation (test mode always uses test prefix)
  - Test user IDs for person assignments and emails [4618, 6465, 11672, 6462]
  - Coverage requirements per layer
  - How to switch between dev and prod environments (VITE_ENVIRONMENT variable)

### Recommended Implementation Order

**Option A: MVP First (Fastest to Value)**
1. Setup (Phase 1)
2. Foundational (Phase 2) ‚Üê **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
3. User Story 1 (Basic Assets) ‚Üê **MVP CORE**
4. User Story 2 (Custom Fields) ‚Üê **Completes MVP**
5. **STOP and VALIDATE** - Deploy MVP
6. User Story 5 (Bookings) ‚Üê **High value P2**
7. User Story 3 (Scanning) ‚Üê **High value P2**
8. Remaining stories as needed

**Option B: Priority Order (By Spec)**
1. Setup + Foundational
2. US1 + US2 (both P1 - asset management foundation)
3. US3, US4, US5 (all P2 - can parallelize if team capacity)
4. US6, US7, US8, US9 (all P3 - can prioritize based on user feedback)

**Option C: Parallel Teams**
1. Setup + Foundational (whole team)
2. Split teams after Phase 2:
   - Team A: US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US4 (asset management track)
   - Team B: US3 (scanning - independent)
   - Team C: US5 ‚Üí US6 (booking track)
3. Merge and integrate
4. Team D: US7, US8, US9 (advanced features)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Foundational Phase** (all can run in parallel after T016-T018 complete):
- T019-T021: API client
- T022-T025: Storage providers
- T026-T028: Utilities
- T029-T030: State stores
- T031-T034: Common components
- T035-T037: Custom hooks

**Within User Story 1** (parallel groups):
- T042-T045: Category UI (after T046 complete for testing)
- T047-T052: Asset UI (after T053-T055 complete for testing)
- T056-T057: Change history UI (after T058 complete)

**Across User Stories** (after Foundational complete):
- US3 (scanning) is independent of US1/US2 - can parallelize
- US4 (parent-child) and US5 (bookings) both depend on US1 but not each other - can parallelize after US1

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# After type definitions are in place (T016-T018), launch all service layers in parallel:

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T015) ‚Üê ~2-4 hours
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T016-T041) ‚Üê **CRITICAL** ~8-16 hours
3. Complete Phase 2.5: Testing Infrastructure (T041a-T041v) ‚Üê **CRITICAL** ~6-10 hours üß™
4. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T042-T063) + automated tests ‚Üê ~20-30 hours
5. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T064-T075) + automated tests ‚Üê ~12-18 hours
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run automated test suite + manual UI testing
7. Deploy/demo basic asset management with custom fields
8. Gather user feedback before continuing

**MVP Scope**: Basic asset tracking with custom categories and fields. Users can:
- Create asset categories with custom field definitions
- Create/edit/delete assets with custom field values
- View asset lists with filtering and sorting
- See change history for audit trail
- This delivers immediate value for basic inventory tracking

### Incremental Delivery (Add Stories Sequentially)

1. MVP (US1 + US2) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
2. Add US5 (Bookings) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy (now have reservation system)
3. Add US3 (Scanning) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy (now have barcode/QR support)
4. Add US4 (Parent-Child) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy (now have bulk asset creation)
5. Add US7 (Stock Take) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy (now have physical inventory audits)
6. Add US8 (Maintenance) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy (now have compliance tracking)
7. Add US6 + US9 as needed (kits + advanced reporting)

**Benefit**: Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality. Users can start using the system early and provide feedback.

### Parallel Team Strategy (If 3+ Developers)

**Week 1**: Whole team on Setup + Foundational (T001-T041)
- **Checkpoint**: Foundation ready, constitution gates pass

**Week 2**: Split into tracks
- **Track A** (2 devs): US1 + US2 (Asset Management)
- **Track B** (1 dev): US3 (Scanning)

**Week 3**: Merge and integrate
- **Checkpoint**: MVP ready with scanning support

**Week 4**: Split again
- **Track A** (2 devs): US5 + US6 (Booking + Kits)
- **Track B** (1 dev): US4 (Parent-Child)

**Week 5**: Final features
- **Track A** (1 dev): US7 (Stock Take)
- **Track B** (1 dev): US8 (Maintenance)
- **Track C** (1 dev): US9 (Reports)

**Week 6**: Polish + Testing + Deployment
- Whole team on Phase 12 (Polish) and quality gates

## Notes

- **[P] marker**: Task can run in parallel with others in its phase (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story (US1-US9) for traceability and independent testing
- **Checkpoint comments**: Natural stopping points to validate story independently before proceeding
- **MVP indicators üéØ**: Tasks that are part of the minimum viable product
- **Blocker indicators ‚ö†Ô∏è**: Tasks that block other work from starting

**Development Approach**:
- Commit after each task or logical group of tasks
- Run TypeScript compilation and ESLint after each phase
- Test user stories independently at checkpoints
- Measure bundle size frequently (especially after adding libraries)
- Use TanStack Query DevTools during development for cache inspection
- Use React DevTools for component performance profiling

**Remember**: Each user story should be independently completable and testable. Avoid creating dependencies between stories unless absolutely necessary. This enables incremental delivery and parallel development.
