## Questions & Answers

### Q1: Booking Approval Workflow

**Category**: Functional Scope - Workflow States

**Question**: Who can approve bookings and what is the approval workflow?

**Answer**: Users with "edit data in categories" permission can approve any booking (including their own for now). Design the permission checking system to be easily changeable when ChurchTools adds more granular extension permissions. Note: ChurchTools handles permissions internally through its permission system API - query permissions at runtime rather than caching them.

**Impact**:
- Phase 7 (Booking & Reservation) implementation
- Permission checking architecture
- Approval UI components

**Functional Requirements Updated**:
- FR-029a: Approval permission definition
- FR-029b: Runtime permission checking (new)
- FR-029c: Future granular permissions planning (new)

### Q2: Maintenance Photo Storage

**Category**: Integration Points - Data Storage

**Question**: How should maintenance photos be stored and accessed?

**Answer**: Store photos as base64 strings (compressed) in Custom Module data category fields for now. Implement client-side compression before encoding (max 1920px width, 85% quality JPEG). Design the storage layer to be easily replaceable when ChurchTools extensions get better access to the Files module and file permissions.

**Impact**:
- Phase 10 (Maintenance Scheduling) implementation
- T172a (photo upload) implementation approach
- Storage architecture design

**Functional Requirements Updated**:
- FR-045: Photo upload specification
- FR-045a: Compression and storage method (new)
- FR-045b: Replaceable storage layer design (new)

---

### Q3: Flexible Kit Asset Allocation

**Category**: Functional Scope - Business Logic

**Question**: When should flexible kit assets be allocated - at booking creation (Pending) or at approval?

**Answer**: Use lazy allocation. Flexible kit bookings in "Pending" status do NOT allocate specific assets. System validates sufficient pool assets exist at booking creation. Actual asset allocation happens when booking is approved. If insufficient assets available at approval time, show error requiring re-booking. Administrators can manually select specific assets during approval process.

**Impact**:
- Phase 8 (Equipment Kits) implementation
- Database schema for kit bookings
- Availability calculation logic

**Functional Requirements Updated**:
- FR-026: Validation at booking creation (modified)
- FR-026a: Allocation at approval (new)
- FR-026b: Insufficient availability handling (new)

---

### Q4: Stock Take Session Concurrency

**Category**: Functional Scope - Multi-User Scenarios

**Question**: Should stock take sessions support multiple concurrent users?

**Answer**: Use shared sessions model. Multiple users can contribute scans to a single stock take session for team-based audits. Implement real-time collaboration with optimistic updates showing "Scanned by [User] at [Time]" for each asset. Session creator owns the session and can close it to generate the final report. All users with view permissions can see live scan progress.

**Impact**:
- Phase 9 (Stock Take) implementation
- Real-time collaboration UI
- Session ownership and permissions

**Functional Requirements Updated**:
- FR-036a: Shared session support (new)
- FR-036b: Real-time scan progress display (new)
- FR-036c: Session ownership and closure (new)
- FR-037: User attribution in scans (modified)

### Q5: Custom Field Schema Evolution

**Category**: Data Model - Schema Evolution

**Question**: How should custom field schema changes be handled (deleting fields, changing types, adding required fields)?

**Answer**: Use permissive with warnings approach. Deleting fields: show warning with count of affected assets, allow deletion, data is soft-deleted (retained but hidden). Changing field types: prevent if incompatible (e.g., Textâ†’Number with non-numeric data), allow with validation warning otherwise. Adding required fields to categories with existing assets: allow but existing assets get null value, show banner prompting bulk update. Renaming fields: allow freely (internal field ID remains constant, only display name changes).

**Impact**:
- Phase 4 (Custom Categories and Fields) implementation
- Data migration strategy
- Validation and warning UI

**Functional Requirements Updated**:
- FR-012a: Custom field deletion with warnings (new)
- FR-012b: Field type change validation (new)
- FR-012c: Adding required fields to existing categories (new)
- FR-012d: Field renaming (new)

---

### Q6: Asset Location Management

**Category**: UX Flow - Data Entry

**Question**: How should asset locations be managed and entered?

**Answer**: Locations should be pre-defined and managed in a dedicated settings menu (similar to asset prefix configuration). When entering an asset's location field, provide searchable autocomplete from existing locations with option to create new location inline if not found. This ensures consistency while allowing flexibility.

**Impact**:
- Phase 12 (System Configuration) - settings implementation
- Phase 3/4 (Asset Management) - location field UI
- Location consistency and data quality

**Functional Requirements Updated**:
- FR-007b: Location management interface in settings (new)
- FR-007c: Searchable autocomplete for location field (new)
- FR-007d: Inline location creation (new)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps

1. âœ… **Review all Session 2025-10-20 clarifications** in spec.md
2. ðŸ”„ **Continue Phase 5**: Address 13 bugs from BUG_FIX_PLAN.md (58 hours estimated)
3. ðŸ“‹ **Plan Phase 12 updates**: Add location management tasks to T227a-c

### Implementation Priorities

**High Priority** (affects multiple phases):
- Runtime permission checking architecture (Phase 7)
- Location management UI (Phase 12, used by Phases 3-10)
- Photo compression utilities (Phase 10)

**Medium Priority** (phase-specific):
- Real-time collaboration features (Phase 9)
- Lazy kit allocation (Phase 8)
- Schema evolution warnings (Phase 4)

### Long-Term Considerations

- **ChurchTools API Evolution**: Monitor for:
  - Granular extension permissions
  - Native file storage access
  - WebSocket support for real-time features

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Base64 photo storage is temporary - plan migration when Files API available
  - Real-time collaboration may require WebSocket or polling strategy

- **Data Migration**:
  - Schema evolution design supports long-term system maintenance
  - Soft-delete approach preserves data integrity
