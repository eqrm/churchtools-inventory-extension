## Remediation Details

### ✅ Issue T1 (HIGH): Phase 2 Status Clarification

**Problem**: Plan.md incorrectly marked T016-T041 as complete when only T001-T015 are actually complete.

**Resolution**: Updated `plan.md` Phase 2 section to accurately reflect:
- Phase 1 (T001-T015): ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 2 (T016-T041): ⏳ READY TO START
- Overall status changed from "COMPLETE" to "PARTIALLY COMPLETE"

**Files Changed**: `specs/001-inventory-management/plan.md`

---

### ✅ Issue A1 (MEDIUM): Export Format Ambiguity

**Problem**: FR-053 stated "export to common formats" without specifying which formats.

**Resolution**: Updated FR-053 to specify:
```
FR-053: System MUST allow export of reports to common formats 
(CSV for data tables, PDF for formatted reports)
```

**Files Changed**: `specs/001-inventory-management/spec.md`

---

### ✅ Issue A2 (MEDIUM): Photo Upload Constraints Missing

**Problem**: FR-045 mentioned "photo uploads" without size/format constraints.

**Resolution**: Updated FR-045 to specify:
```
FR-045: System MUST allow maintenance technicians to record completed 
maintenance with notes and photo uploads (up to 10 photos per record, 
max 5MB each, formats: JPG, PNG, HEIC, WebP)
```

**Files Changed**: `specs/001-inventory-management/spec.md`

---

### ✅ Issue U1 (MEDIUM): Prefix Configuration Underspecified

**Problem**: FR-007 mentioned "configure prefix" but didn't describe the UI or validation rules.

**Resolution**: Updated FR-007 to specify:
```
FR-007: System MUST allow administrators to configure the 
organization-specific global asset number prefix via settings interface 
(2-10 alphanumeric characters, validated on save, affects all new assets)
```

**Files Changed**: `specs/001-inventory-management/spec.md`

---

### ✅ Issue D1 (LOW): Bundle Size Comment Inaccurate

**Problem**: T041 comment said "should be ~50-60 KB at this stage" but actual baseline is 138.50 KB after Phase 1.

**Resolution**: Updated T041 comment to:
```
Bundle size baseline measured (Phase 1 complete: 138.50 KB with all 
dependencies; will decrease after Phase 2 tree shaking)
```

**Files Changed**: `specs/001-inventory-management/tasks.md`

---

### ✅ Issue D2 (LOW): AssetNumberService Path Inconsistency

**Problem**: T028 referenced `src/services/utils/AssetNumberService.ts` but other utilities use `src/utils/` and plan.md shows `assetNumbers.ts`.

**Resolution**: Updated T028 and T054 to use consistent path:
```
T028: Create asset number generator utility in src/utils/assetNumbers.ts 
(matches formatters.ts pattern)
```

**Files Changed**: `specs/001-inventory-management/tasks.md`

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Ready to Execute)

1. **Begin Phase 2 Implementation**
   ```bash
   # Start with T016-T018: Copy contract types
   # Then proceed with T019-T041 in parallel groups
   ```

2. **Verify Constitution Gates** (after Phase 2 complete)
   ```bash
   npm run build        # Verify TypeScript compilation (T038)
   npm run lint         # Verify ESLint passes (T039)
   npm run build:stats  # Measure bundle size (T041)
   ```

### Phase 3+ (After Phase 2 Complete)

3. **Implement MVP (User Stories 1 + 2)**
   - T042-T063: User Story 1 (Basic Asset Creation)
   - T064-T075: User Story 2 (Custom Fields)
   - Estimated: 40-60 hours total
   - Delivers: Complete basic asset management

4. **Deploy MVP for User Testing**
   - Gather feedback on core functionality
   - Validate usability and performance
   - Prioritize remaining user stories based on feedback
