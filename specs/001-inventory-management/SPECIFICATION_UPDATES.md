**Branch**: `001-inventory-management`  
**Source**: Analysis findings and implementation clarifications  
**Status**: COMPLETE

---

## Summary of Changes

Updated specification artifacts to address analysis findings and clarify implementation requirements based on testing results.

### Changes Made

1. **Clarified Notification System** - ChurchTools email service API
2. **Added Asset Prefix Configuration** - Settings page with UI requirements
3. **Converted Edge Cases to Requirements** - 9 new testable FRs
4. **Added Maintenance Photo Upload** - Explicit task for photo uploads
5. **Updated Task Count** - 256 → 271 tasks (15 new tasks)

---

## 1. Notification System Clarification

### Issue
- Spec.md mentioned "ChurchTools' native notification system" but implementation approach was unclear
- Analysis identified this as underspecified (Issue C2)

### Resolution
**Updated spec.md**:
- FR-035: Booking reminders now specify "via ChurchTools email service API"
- FR-043, FR-044: Maintenance reminders now specify "via ChurchTools email service API"
- FR-062, FR-069: Edge case notifications specify "via ChurchTools email service"

**Updated plan.md**:
- Technical Context: Added "email service" to ChurchTools Client dependency
- Specification Clarifications section added documenting email service approach

**Added to tasks.md**:
- **T185**: Implement ChurchToolsEmailService.ts wrapper for email API
- **T186**: Maintenance reminder emails (replaces generic "notification system")
- **T128a**: Booking reminder emails implementation

**Impact**: Clear implementation path for all notifications

---

## 2. Asset Prefix Configuration Settings

### Issue
- FR-007 requires prefix configuration UI but no explicit tasks existed
- Analysis identified coverage gap (Issue C1)
- FR-007a added for enhanced UI requirements

### Resolution
**Added to spec.md**:
- **FR-007a**: Detailed requirements for prefix settings UI
  - Display current prefix with next number preview
  - Show count of existing assets using prefix
  - Warn about consistency impact of changing prefix

**Added to tasks.md (Phase 12)**:
- **T227a**: Create SettingsPage.tsx component
- **T227b**: Create AssetPrefixSettings.tsx component with preview and warnings
- **T227c**: Add settings route and navigation menu link

**Impact**: 
- Settings infrastructure for future configuration needs
- Clear UI requirements for asset prefix management

---

## 3. Edge Cases Converted to Requirements

### Issue
- 9 edge cases listed in spec.md but not converted to testable requirements
- Analysis identified underspecification (Issue U2)

### Resolution
**Added to spec.md**:
- **FR-062**: Booking cancellation when asset becomes unavailable
- **FR-063**: Duplicate scan prevention in stock take
- **FR-064**: Parent asset deletion protection (with active child bookings)
- **FR-065**: Kit component conflict detection
- **FR-066**: Manual maintenance record creation (forgot to scan)
- **FR-067**: Optimistic locking for simultaneous bookings
- **FR-068**: Barcode regeneration when damaged
- **FR-069**: Damaged asset check-in handling
- **FR-070**: Insufficient flexible kit availability handling

**Added to tasks.md (Phase 12)**:
- **T241a** through **T241i**: 9 tasks for edge case implementations
- Each task maps directly to one FR with explicit acceptance criteria

**Impact**: 
- All edge cases now have testable requirements
- Clear implementation guidance for exception handling
- Improved system robustness

---

## 4. Maintenance Photo Upload Implementation

### Issue
- FR-045 specifies photo upload (10 photos, 5MB each) but no explicit tasks
- Analysis identified implementation gap (Issue I4)

### Resolution
**Added to tasks.md (Phase 10)**:
- **T172a**: Implement photo upload in MaintenanceRecordForm
  - Use Mantine Dropzone component
  - Enforce: up to 10 photos, max 5MB each
  - Formats: JPG, PNG, HEIC, WebP
  - Store in ChurchTools file storage

**Split original T172**:
- T172: MaintenanceRecordForm with notes input
- T172a: Photo upload implementation (new)

**Impact**: 
- Clear implementation task for photo upload feature
- Prevents oversight during Phase 10 development

## Impact Analysis

### Requirements Coverage
- **Before**: 61 functional requirements, 100% task coverage
- **After**: 70 functional requirements (+9 edge cases, +1 settings), 100% task coverage maintained
- **Result**: ✅ No coverage gaps introduced

### Constitution Compliance
- **Type Safety**: ✅ No impact (still TypeScript strict mode)
- **UX Consistency**: ✅ Improved (settings UI specified)
- **Code Quality**: ✅ No impact (ESLint still enforced)
- **Performance Budget**: ✅ No impact (email service is lightweight)
- **Testing**: ✅ Improved (edge cases now testable)

### Implementation Timeline Impact
- **MVP (Phases 1-4)**: No change - already complete
- **Phase 5 (Bug Fixes)**: No change - already planned
- **Phases 7, 10**: +3 tasks (T128a, T172a, T185-186) - ~12 hours additional
- **Phase 12**: +12 tasks (T227a-c, T241a-i) - ~30 hours additional
- **Total Impact**: +42 hours (~1 week for 1 developer)

### Risk Mitigation
- ✅ **Notification system**: Clear implementation path (email service)
- ✅ **Edge cases**: Explicit handling prevents production surprises
- ✅ **Photo uploads**: Won't be forgotten in Phase 10

## Next Steps

### Immediate (No Action Required)
- ✅ Spec.md updated with new requirements

### Phase 12 (Polish)
- 12 new tasks to implement (T227a-c, T241a-i)
