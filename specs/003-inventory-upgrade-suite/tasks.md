# Tasks: Inventory Upgrade Suite

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-inventory-upgrade-suite/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md

**Tests**: Included where the specification or research highlights critical logic (booking quantity allocation, maintenance stage reducers, demo seeding reliability). All other stories rely on manual QA noted in independent tests.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions


## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Ensure environment configuration and tooling align with the implementation plan before feature work begins.

- [X] T001 Update `.env.example` with `VITE_KEY` / `VITE_BASE_URL` guidance and onboarding notes (`/.env.example`)
- [X] T002 Add bundle analysis script using `vite-bundle-visualizer` to `package.json` and document usage in `README.md` (`/package.json`, `/README.md`)
- [X] T003 [P] Create Vitest configuration enabling React Testing Library and coverage thresholds (`/vitest.config.ts`)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure shared across all user stories.

- [X] T004 Memoize ChurchTools storage provider and export singleton utilities (`/src/services/churchTools/storageProvider.ts`)
- [X] T005 [P] Define shared history event types and adapters for TanStack Query (`/src/utils/history/types.ts`, `/src/hooks/useHistoryEvents.ts`)
- [X] T006 Initialize Dexie schema extensions for demo metadata and history caching (`/src/state/offline/db.ts`)
- [X] T007 Establish lazy-loaded route bundles for maintenance dashboard modules to protect bundle budget (`/src/pages/MaintenanceDashboard.tsx`, `/src/router/index.ts`)
- [X] T008 Add instrumentation to confirm single storage provider initialization and document metrics hook (`/src/utils/metrics/storageProviderInstrumentation.ts`)
- [X] T009 [P] Update ESLint/Vitest integration to cover new folders (`/.eslintrc.cjs`, `/package.json`)

**Constitution Compliance Gates**
- Confirm TypeScript strict mode remains enabled in `/tsconfig.json`
- Validate lint configuration covers new directories via `npm run lint`
- Ensure `.env.example` reflects required variables and explanations
- Record bundle baseline in `/docs/performance/baseline.md`
- Execute `npm test` and verify Vitest passes

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready â€“ user story work can begin.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

1. **Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2**: Setup tasks must finish before foundational work begins.
2. **Phase 2 â†’ User Stories**: All foundational tasks complete (including constitution gates) before any user story starts.
3. **User Story Order**: US1 and US2 (both P1) can commence once the foundation is ready; US3 and US4 (P2) follow, and US5 (P3) can start after at least one P2 story completes or in parallel if resourced.
4. **Within Stories**:
   - Execute tests before implementation tasks (write tests â†’ watch fail â†’ implement â†’ pass).
   - Follow logical dependency: data/services before UI integrations.
5. **Phase 8**: Begins only after desired user stories are delivered; serves as release polish and validation.

### Story Dependency Graph
- US1 âŸ‚ US2 (parallel after foundation)
- US3 depends on prefix-related foundation tasks (T005, T006, T008 indirectly) and can start after US1 if resource constrained.
- US4 depends on Dexie foundation (T006) and environment flags (T035 from same story, but ensure T006 complete first).
- US5 depends on shared avatar component work after foundation; documentation tasks can run once relevant features stabilize.

---

## Parallel Execution Examples

- **Foundation**: T005 and T009 can run alongside T006 once T004 scaffolds shared services.
- **User Story 1**: T012 and T015 can proceed in parallel, while T013 waits for both to integrate.
- **User Story 2**: T019 and T020 can start together; T022 depends on T019.
- **User Story 4**: T032 and T033 can run concurrently prior to wiring UI (T031).
- **Polish**: T043, T046, and T048 can be executed in parallel after feature development.

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1)
1. Complete Phases 1â€“2.
2. Deliver Phase 3 (US1) with automated tests (T010â€“T017).
3. Validate via independent test and bundle check; this is the MVP for release if schedule tight.

### Incremental Delivery
- **Increment 1**: US1
- **Increment 2**: US2 (maintenance orchestration)
- **Increment 3**: US3 (numbering transparency)
- **Increment 4**: US4 (demo onboarding)
- **Increment 5**: US5 (people context & docs)

### Team Parallelization
- Developer A: US1 + shared history components
- Developer B: US2 maintenance workflows
- Developer C: US4 demo onboarding (after foundation)
- Developer D: US3 numbering + US5 documentation 

Coordinate merges after each phase checkpoint, ensuring tests and bundle checks run before integration.
