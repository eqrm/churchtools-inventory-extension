---

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: User story label (US1-US10) - only for user story phases
- File paths use absolute paths from repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Install new libraries and update project configuration

- [x] T001 Install @fullcalendar/react dependencies: `npm install @fullcalendar/react @fullcalendar/daygrid @fullcalendar/timegrid` (~45KB)
- [x] T002 Install Material Design Icons: `npm install @mdi/js @mdi/react` (~5KB per 50 icons)
- [x] T003 [P] Install Dexie.js for offline storage: `npm install dexie` (~15KB)
- [x] T004 [P] Install browser-image-compression: `npm install browser-image-compression` (~15KB)
- [x] T005 Verify bundle size after installations (should be ~83KB additional, well within 5MB budget)

### Base Path Configuration (Critical)

**Note**: Base path = `/ccm/fkoinventorymanagement/` (Vite calls it `base`, React Router calls it `basename`)

- [x] T015 Update src/App.tsx to add `basename={import.meta.env.BASE_URL}` to BrowserRouter for route refresh fix
- [x] T016 Test route refresh on all pages: Dashboard, Assets, Kits, Bookings, Reports, Settings (all should work without errors)
- [x] T017 Test browser back/forward navigation (should work correctly)
- [x] T018 Test deep links from external sources (should load correct page)

- **US1 - Navigation** (P0): No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ
- **US2 - Person Search** (P0): No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ
- **US3 - Book for Others** (P1): Depends on US2 (PersonPicker) ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **US9 - Dev Workflow** (P2): No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ
- **US10 - Offline Stock Take** (P2): Depends on US2 (PersonCache) ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Recommended Execution Order

**Week 1** (P0 - Critical Bugs): 
1. Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007)
2. Phase 2: Foundational (T008-T020) ‚Üê **MUST COMPLETE FIRST**

  - Feature completions (T272-T276)
  - QA & Security (T277-T295)
  - Multi-Prefix Support - E5 (T296-T303)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Setup (Phase 1)**: T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel

**Within Foundational (Phase 2)**: T008-T014 (types and services) can run in parallel

**After Foundational Complete**:
- US1 (Navigation) + US2 (Person Search) can run in parallel
- US6 (Images) + US7 (Schema) + US9 (Dev Workflow) can run in parallel
- API Fixes + Kit Fixes can run in parallel

**Within User Stories**:
- All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)
- Models can be created in parallel
- Services can be created in parallel (if no dependencies)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Person Search)

```bash
# Can run in parallel (different files):
T032: Create PersonSearchService.ts
T033: Implement ChurchTools API integration
T034: Add debounce
T035: Implement memory cache
T036: Implement localStorage cache
T037: Transform API response
T038: Create usePersonSearch.ts hook
T039: Create PersonPicker.tsx component

# Must run sequentially:
T040: Integrate PersonPicker into BookingForm (depends on T039)
T041-T046: Testing (depends on integration complete)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Critical Path Only - Week 1)

**Goal**: Get core application working without errors

1. ‚úÖ Phase 1: Setup (install libraries, configure base path)
2. ‚úÖ Phase 2: Foundational (types, interfaces, base path fix) ‚Üê **CRITICAL**
3. ‚úÖ Phase 3: US1 - Navigation (route refresh fix) ‚Üê **HIGHEST IMPACT**
4. ‚úÖ Phase 4: US2 - Person Search (real data in bookings)
5. ‚úÖ Phase 8: API Error Fixes (prefixes, maintenance)
6. ‚úÖ Phase 9: Kit/Report Fixes (navigation)

**Result**: Application is usable, no critical bugs, ready for user testing

### Incremental Delivery (Add Features Week by Week)

**Week 2-3**: Add booking enhancements (US3-US5, localization)
**Week 4**: Add UX polish (UI improvements, settings, offline)
**Week 5-6**: Add advanced features (images, migrations, documentation)

Each increment adds value without breaking existing functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers after Foundational phase complete:

- **Developer A**: US1 (Navigation) ‚Üí US2 (Person Search) ‚Üí US3 (Book for Others)
- **Developer B**: API Fixes ‚Üí Kit Fixes ‚Üí US4 (Smart Dates) ‚Üí US5 (Availability)
- **Developer C**: US6 (Images) ‚Üí US7 (Schema) ‚Üí US8 (Photo Migration)

All merge into main branch, integrate at end.
