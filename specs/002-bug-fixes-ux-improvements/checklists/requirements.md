# Specification Quality Checklist: Bug Fixes & UX Improvements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 22, 2025  
**Updated**: October 22, 2025 (Enhanced with README content)  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: âœ… PASSED (Enhanced)

**Update Summary**: Specification enhanced with content from repository README files:
- Added 3 new user stories (Photo Storage Migration, Dev Workflow, Offline Stock Take)
- Expanded from 64 to 85 functional requirements (+21 requirements)
- Added photo storage abstraction requirements (FR-065 to FR-070)
- Added development workflow requirements (FR-071 to FR-076)
- Added offline capability requirements (FR-077 to FR-081)
- Added API integration requirements (FR-082 to FR-085)
- Expanded Key Entities to include PhotoStorage, CustomDataCategory, OfflineCache
- Expanded Success Criteria from 20 to 30 metrics (+10 metrics)
- Enhanced edge cases with photo migration, Safari, and sync scenarios

**Content Sources Consolidated**:
1. `/README.md` - Project overview, dev workflow, deployment, UI integration metrics
2. `/README-UI-DOCS.md` - Documentation structure, feature access paths, training materials
3. `/src/services/storage/README.md` - Photo storage abstraction, migration strategy, API reference
4. `/specs/PHASE13-IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Original bug list and feature requests (33 tasks)

**Key Enhancements**:

1. **Content Quality**: All requirements remain technology-agnostic while being more comprehensive
   - Photo storage described as "abstraction layer" not "IPhotoStorage interface"
   - Development workflow focuses on developer experience, not specific tools
   - Offline capability described in user terms (scan, sync) not technical implementation

2. **Requirement Completeness**: 
   - 85 functional requirements covering all aspects from PHASE13 and README files
   - 15 edge cases covering photo migration, browser compatibility, offline sync
   - 10 user stories with clear priorities (P0, P1, P2, P3)

3. **Success Criteria**: 
   - 30 measurable outcomes (was 20)
   - All technology-agnostic and user-focused
   - New metrics for: photo migration, dev workflow, offline operations, deployment size
   - Specific numbers: <10s startup, 5MB photos, 20MB deployment, 100% data integrity

4. **Feature Readiness**: 
   - Complete coverage of user testing bugs (from PHASE13)
   - Complete coverage of infrastructure requirements (from READMEs)
   - All 172+ components remain functional (no regressions)
   - Ready for planning phase with comprehensive scope

**Ready for**: `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

**Scope Summary**:
- **Critical Bugs (P0)**: 6 tasks - routing, person search, API errors, kit/report fixes
- **High Priority (P1)**: 8 tasks - booking enhancements, language, filtering
- **Medium Priority (P2)**: 13 tasks - UX polish, dev workflow, offline, documentation
- **Advanced (P3)**: 13 tasks - images, versioning, photo migration, master data

**Total Requirements**: 85 functional requirements across 10 categories
**Total Success Metrics**: 30 measurable outcomes
**Total User Stories**: 10 independently testable scenarios
**Total Edge Cases**: 15 boundary conditions

**Quality Validation**: All checklist items remain PASSED after enhancement
