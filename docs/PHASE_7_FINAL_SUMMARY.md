## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### State Management
- **TanStack Query** for server state
- Query key structure: `bookingKeys.all/lists/list/details/detail`
- Intelligent cache invalidation (bookings + assets)
- Optimistic UI updates

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Entity types: `Booking`, `BookingCreate`, `BookingUpdate`, `BookingFilters`
- Status enum: `BookingStatus` (6 states)
- Condition types: 5 rating levels with photos

### Storage Layer
```
ChurchTools Custom Module
  └── __Bookings__ (System Category)
      ├── Booking data (JSON)
      ├── Asset references (id, assetNumber, name)
      ├── Person info (id, name)
      ├── Date ranges (ISO strings)
      ├── Status workflow
      └── Change history
```

### Business Logic
- **Availability**: Date range overlap detection
- **Conflict Prevention**: Checks approved/active bookings
- **Validation**: Dates, asset status, availability
- **Status Workflow**: Pending → Approved → Active → Completed
- **Asset Sync**: Booking status changes update asset
- **Damage Detection**: Condition rating sets asset.status
- **Cancellation**: State validation, asset freeing
