## Known Issues

1. **BookingDetailPage** - Exceeds 50-line limit (82 lines)
   - Functional but needs refactoring
   - Could extract modal components

2. **Calendar View** - Basic implementation only
   - Needs full Mantine Calendar integration
   - Visual calendar with date overlays pending

## Performance Considerations

- **Code Splitting**: All booking pages lazy-loaded
- **Route Prefetching**: React Router handles prefetch
- **Component Reuse**: BookingForm used in multiple contexts
- **Query Caching**: TanStack Query caches booking data

## Next Steps

1. **Test End-to-End**: Complete user flows
2. **Add Calendar Integration**: Full visual calendar
3. **Enhance Mobile**: Optimize layouts for mobile
4. **Add Breadcrumbs**: Navigation breadcrumbs
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Track page load times
